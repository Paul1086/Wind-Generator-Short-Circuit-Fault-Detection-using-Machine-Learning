# Wind-Generator-Short-Circuit-Fault-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Currently working on this project, and planning to write up a paper. Will be uploading the project very soon.

Some of my other machine learning projects are:

* Predicting Load Grades using Machine Learning <br />
  Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras <br />
